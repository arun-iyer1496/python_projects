# python_projects
This repository contains basic python projects for beginners.
This project generates a random number using the "Random" library of Python.
From the random library, we use the randint function that generates a random mumber 
by taking two arguements viz.the start and end number.
Once the number is generated, the user is asked to enter any number within the range.
Depending upon the input entered by the user, the program will print whether the guess is too high or low
And if the user enters the same number that is generated by the code, the appropriate statement will be printed and the code will be exited.
If the guess entered by the user is incorrect, the user has to press the numeric 1 key and the generated number will be displayed to the user.
